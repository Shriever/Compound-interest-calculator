# Compound Interest Calculator

## Why I'm making this

I like using these types of tools, so I decided to put
my coding skills to the test and make one. 

## New Skills
In this project, I used TypeScript for the first time. 
It has definitely brought a few new challenges into my workflow, 
but it was also very nice to have that extra layer of debugging when I needed it.

I'd say this project has been a success!
